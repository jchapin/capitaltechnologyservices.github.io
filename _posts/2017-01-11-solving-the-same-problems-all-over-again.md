Here's the part where I confess that software development teams frequently have
to go back and dig up a problem that was once considered by all parties as
being, "solved".

Well that's a shock isn't it? The team is wasting your money aren't they?

Possibly not, and here is why.

The first Bentley to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans race the team covered a total
distance of 2077.341 kilometers. Six years later a Bentley won the race and
covered 2930.663 kilometers. The last team to win the race in a Bentley covered
an astonishing 5146.05 kilometers.

The years of these races were 1924, 1930, and 2003.

The engines were a four cylinder 3.0 L making 70hp, a six cylinder 6.5 L engine
making 200hp, and an eight cylinder 4.0 L engine rated at 600hp.

The challenge was exactly the same, run a car for 24 hours straight and cover
as much distance as possible. But the technology advanced considerably during
the periods of six and seventy three years in between wins.

The point is that you need to make sure that your development team is not
continually solving the same problems under the same conditions or only to
achieve the same results. Every bit of work that goes into your product has to
be a demonstrable improvement upon what existed before.

This is why our teams make sure that your product collects a considerable amount
of performance data with every project. It's not just the pass/fail rates of
unit tests that ensure the quality of our work. It also includes profiling each
request to your site or web application and understanding how the application
will behave under increased load from a geographically dispersed audience.

Yes, sometimes we solve the same problems we solved six months ago, but when
the conditions change and our clients business is growing, we are dedicated to
going the greater distance with them.
