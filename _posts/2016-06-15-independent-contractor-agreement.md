    on {{ page.contract_effective_date }} and continuing until terminated in
    accordance with Section 4.

1.  **Duties.** Contractor agrees to perform work for the Company on the terms
    and conditions set forth in this agreement, and agrees to devote all
    necessary time and attention (reasonable periods of illness accepted) to the
    performance of the duties specified in this agreement.  Contractor’s duties

    established, and shall perform the duties assigned faithfully,
    intelligently, to the best of their ability, and in the best interest of the
    Company.

## 2. Confidentiality

1.  **Confidentiality.** Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all financial
    and accounting records, lists of property owned by Company, including
    amounts paid therefore, client and customer lists, and other Company data
    and information related to its business (hereinafter collectively
    “Confidential Information”) are valuable assets of the Company. Except for
    disclosures required to be made to advance the business of the Company and
    information which is a matter of public record, Contractor shall not, during
    the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement,
    disclose any Confidential Information to any person or use any Confidential
    Information for the benefit of Contractor or any other person, except with
    the prior written consent of the Company.

1.  **Return of Documents.** Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all
    originals and copies of records, reports, documents, lists, plans,
    memoranda, notes and other documentation related to the business of the
    Company or containing any Confidential Information shall be the sole and
    exclusive property of the Company, and shall be returned to the Company upon
    the termination of this Agreement or upon the written request of the
    Company.

1.  **Ownership of Work Product.** The Services and all deliverables and other
    work product developed by Contractor in the performance of the Services,
    including all intellectual property, moral and other proprietary rights
    therein (collectively, “Work Product”) are a “work made for hire,” and shall
    be solely owned by the Company. Contractor’s work has been specially ordered
    by the Company. Contractor’s work is derivative of the Company’s previous
    work and merely a contribution to the Company’s collective work. The
    Company is the sole author of the Services, its contents, and any work
    embodying or derived from any portion of the Services. The Company is also
    the owner of all the intellectual property related to the Services,
    including but not limited to all technology, inventions, discoveries,
    improvements, copyrightable works, ideas, applications for patents, patents
    and trademarks related to the Services (collectively, the “Intellectual
    Property”). To the extent that the Services or any Work Product created by
    Contractor, its agents or employees in the delivery of the Services are not
    properly characterized as “work made for hire,” or to the extent that the
    Work Product incorporates any pre-existing intellectual property of
    Contractor prior to the date of this Agreement, then Contractor will, and
    hereby does, grant The Company a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
    irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable
    license to use, modify, copy and distribute such intellectual property.

1.  **Injunction.** Contractor agrees that it would be difficult to measure
    damage to the Company from any breach by Contractor of Section 2.1 or 2.2
    and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for such breach.
    Accordingly, Contractor agrees that if Contractor shall breach Section 2.1
    or 2.2, the Company shall be entitled to, in addition to all other remedies
    it may have at law or equity, to an injunction or other appropriate orders
    to restrain any such breach, without showing or proving actual damages
    sustained by the Company.

1.  **No Release.** Contractor agrees that the termination of this Agreement
    shall not release Contractor from any obligations under Section 2.1, 2.2, or
    2.3.

## 3. Compensation

1.  **Compensation.** In consideration of all services to be rendered by
    Contractor to the Company, the Company shall pay to the Contractor based on
    number of hours worked multiplied by the current rate of the applicable
    staff member on the Contractor’s rate schedule. A copy of the current rate
    schedule is attached to this document. Said compensation shall be paid on a
    monthly basis with the balance of invoices due within 30 days.

1.  **Withholding; Other Benefits.** Compensation paid pursuant to this
    Agreement shall not subject to the customary withholding of income taxes
    and other employment taxes. Contractor shall be solely responsible for
    reporting and paying any such taxes. The Company shall not provide
    Contractor with any coverage or participation in the Company’s accident and
    health insurance, life insurance, disability income insurance, medical
    expense reimbursement, wage continuation plans, or other fringe benefits
    provided to regular employees.

1.  **Expenses.** Company shall reimburse Contractor all reasonable and
    necessary expenses incurred by Contractor in connection with the performance
    of his duties hereunder, provided, the President or Managing Director of the
    Company has approved such expenses in advance.

## 4. Termination

    immediately, at will, and in the sole discretion of the President of the
    Company. Contractor may terminate this Agreement upon fourteen (14) days
    written notice to the Company. This Agreement also may be terminated at
    any time upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and Contractor.

1.  **Death.** In the event Contractor dies during the term of this Agreement,
    this Agreement shall terminate, and the Company shall pay to Contractor’s
    estate the salary which would otherwise be payable to Contractor.

## 5. Independent Contractor Status

agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of Company. Contractor shall have no
authority to bind or otherwise obligate Contractor in any manner nor shall
Contractor represent to anyone that it has a right to do so. Contractor

a result of a violation of this provision Contractor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company for any such loss or damage.

## 6. Representations of Warranties of Contractor
