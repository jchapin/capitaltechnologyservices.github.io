    accordance with Section 4.

1.  **Duties.** Contractor agrees to perform work for the Company on the terms

    necessary time and attention (reasonable periods of illness accepted) to the
    performance of the duties specified in this agreement. Contractor’s duties

    assurance, deployment, documentation, project management, and tasks

    time established, and shall perform the duties assigned faithfully,
    intelligently, to the best of their ability, and in the best interest of the
    Company.

## 2. Confidentiality

1.  **Confidentiality.** Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all source
    code, financial and accounting records, lists of property owned by Company,
    including amounts paid therefore, client and customer lists, and other
    Company data and information related to its business (hereinafter
    collectively “Confidential Information”) are valuable assets of the Company.
    Except for disclosures required to be made to advance the business of the
    Company and information which is a matter of public record, Contractor shall
    not, during the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this
    Agreement, disclose any Confidential Information to any person or use any
    Confidential Information for the benefit of Contractor or any other person,
    except with the prior written consent of the Company.

1.  **Return of Documents.** Contractor acknowledges and agrees that all
    originals and copies of records, reports, documents, lists, plans,
    memoranda, notes and other documentation related to the business of the
    Company or containing any Confidential Information shall be the sole and
    exclusive property of the Company, and shall be returned to the Company upon
    the termination of this Agreement or upon the written request of the
    Company.

1.  **Ownership of Work Product.** The Services and all deliverables and other
    work product developed by Contractor in the performance of the Services,
    including all intellectual property, moral and other proprietary rights
    therein (collectively, “Work Product”) are a “work made for hire,” and shall
    be solely owned by the Company. Contractor’s work has been specially ordered
    by the Company. Contractor’s work is derivative of the Company’s previous
    work and merely a contribution to the Company’s collective work. The
    Company is the sole author of the Services, its contents, and any work
    embodying or derived from any portion of the Services. The Company is also
    the owner of all the intellectual property related to the Services,

    properly characterized as “work made for hire,” or to the extent that the
    Work Product incorporates any pre-existing intellectual property of
    Contractor prior to the date of this Agreement, then Contractor will, and
    hereby does, grant The Company a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
    irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable
    license to use, modify, copy and distribute such intellectual property.

1.  **Injunction.** Contractor agrees that it would be difficult to measure
    damage to the Company from any breach by Contractor of Section 2.1 or 2.2
    and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for such breach.
    Accordingly, Contractor agrees that if Contractor shall breach Section 2.1
    or 2.2, the Company shall be entitled to, in addition to all other remedies
    it may have at law or equity, to an injunction or other appropriate orders
    to restrain any such breach, without showing or proving actual damages
    sustained by the Company.

    2.3.

    due within 30 days of submission of a time record or invoice.

    Agreement shall not subject to the customary withholding of income taxes
    and other employment taxes. Contractor shall be solely responsible for
    reporting and paying any such taxes. The Company shall not provide
    Contractor with any coverage or participation in the Company’s accident and
    health insurance, life insurance, disability income insurance, medical
    expense reimbursement, wage continuation plans, or other fringe benefits
    provided to regular employees.

    written notice to the Company. This Agreement also may be terminated at
    any time upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and Contractor.

1.  **Death.** In the event Contractor dies during the term of this Agreement,
    this Agreement shall terminate, and the Company shall pay to Contractor’s
    estate the compensation which would otherwise be payable to Contractor.

harmless the Company for any such loss or damage.
