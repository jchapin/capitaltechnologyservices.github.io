       ***N***egotiable. Specifications must express why the proposed work is
       ***V***aluable to the Customer. Every specification must be
       ***E***stimable by the Developer. Scope of specifications should be
       ***S***mall for lowering the risk associated with changes to code.
       ***T***ests must be defined for every functional requirement. Finally,
       ***E***xample cases and outcomes must be defined when possible.
